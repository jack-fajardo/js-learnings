🧠 Core Concepts To Be Mastered

🔁 Array Methods
- reduce() → Aggregation, transformation, grouping, counting
- map() → Element-wise transformation
- filter() → Conditional selection
- sort() → Custom sorting logic (numeric, string, object properties)

🧮 Object Utilities
- Object.entries() → Convert object to array of [key, value] pairs
- Object.keys() / Object.values() → Extract keys or values
- Object transformation → Mapping entries into structured objects

🗃️ Data Structures
- Arrays of objects → Searching, grouping, deduping
- Plain objects → Used as hash maps for counting and grouping
- Map → Key-value store with dynamic updates and lookups

🔍 Searching & Matching
- find() → Locate specific object in array
- Manual search via filter() or reduce() for custom logic

🧹 Deduplication
- Removing duplicates from arrays using:
- Set
- reduce
- filter with index checks

📊 Aggregation Patterns
- Grouping by property (e.g. user, age, product)
- Counting occurrences
- Calculating totals, averages, and frequencies

🧾 Real-World Logic
- Invoice summaries
- Word frequency dashboards
- User activity tracking
- Sorting and filtering analytics data

🧩 Fusion Techniques
- Chaining multiple array methods for clean pipelines
- Converting objects to arrays for sorting and filtering
- Using conditional logic inside map() to enrich data (e.g. tagging importance)
